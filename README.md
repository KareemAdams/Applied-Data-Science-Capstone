# Project: SpaceX Falcon9 First Stage Landing Prediction

In this project, we will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.


# Lab 1: Data Collection using SpaceX API
In this lab, data is collected from the SpaceX API and make sure it's is the correct format. GET request will be made to the SpaceX API and some basic data wrangling and formating will be done.

# Lab 2: Data Collection using Web Scraping
In this lab, web scraping will be performed using BeautifulSoup package to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled 'List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches

# Lab 3: Data Wrangling
In this lab, some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

# Lab 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
In this lab, the Spacex dataset will be loaded into a Db2 database and SQL queries are executed to better understand the data.

# Lab 5: Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualization
In this lab, EDA and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib will be performed.

# Lab 6: Data Visualization using Folium
In this lab, more interactive visual analytics using Folium will be performed.

# Lab 7: Plotly Dashboard
In this lab, an interactive dashboard app based on the SpaceX dataset will be created, using Dash and Plotly packages.

# Lab 8: SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction
In this lab, machine learning pipeline will be created to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
